I grew up in a small town in Iowa. My graduating high school class had 56 students. I was one of three kids that left the state to attend college. I ended up going to a college that was on the Wisconsin/Illinois border, roughly 300 miles from home.
It was place I was completely unfamiliar with and I didn't have friends or family nearby to rely on. 

While it certainly wasn't the most rational thing to do at the time,
it was an amazing experience. It was something that really helped strengthen my ability to be self-reliant, which has shaped how I approach things on a day-to-day basis. 
I take a lot of pride in knowing that if I'm presented with a task or problem that I'm completely unfamiliar with, that I'll be able to figure it out.
